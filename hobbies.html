    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <h3>I love to program! I learned most of it all on my own.</h3>
    <p>In school I learned how to make a website in asp.net.
        This was a fake accountancy firm we must make and it needed a website.
        On the site we could log in and make order/notes online
        There was a client database, so the clients could log onto the website.
    </p>
    <p>While doing this in school, I started to make Tetris in visual basic.
        The game worked perfectly and there was even cheat codes available to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        From that moment I was hooked at programming, design,...
    </p>
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <h3>Ooh man I love me some good gaming sessions</h3>
    <p>Once I am playing I can not let it down easily</p>
    <p>Games like Borderlands, The witcher, Diablo,... serveral 100 of hours</p>
    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <h3>Preferable digital arts</h3>
    <p>I always like drawing, but I needed to be in the mood for it</p>
    <p>Recently I bought myself a drawing tablet, and this is what I really like</p>
    <p>Made a couple of arts, but for the moment it is on hold</p>
